# Downloads

Downloads is a software solution designed to serve as a central hub for managing content downloads from various sources across the network. This application simplifies the download process by consolidating multiple download methods into a single, user-friendly interface.
### Main Features
* **Centralized Download Management:** Users can efficiently manage and monitor all their downloads in one location, eliminating the need to switch between different download tools.

* **Support for Download Engines:** The system supports the integration of various external download software through extensions. These extensions, referred to as Download Engines, can be easily added to extend the system's capabilities. 

* **Multi-Protocol Support:** Multiple Protocols (such as Bittorrent, FTP, and more) can be supported through Download Engines.

* **API Support:** The system includes a RESTful API that allows users and developers to initiate, manage, and query downloads programmatically. This feature enables integration with other systems and automation tools.

* **Workflows:** The system supports creating custom workflows that can trigger actions based on specific download events (e.g., download finished, failed, paused). This feature allows users to automate post-download actions such as file processing, notifications, or transferring files to another location.

* **Multiple Storage Backends:** The system supports a variety of storage backends, enabling users to save downloads to local storage as well as remote locations like network shares (NFS, SMB), FTP, FTPS, SSHFS, and other protocols.
